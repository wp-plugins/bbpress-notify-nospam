== Description ==
This is a modification of the original bbPress-Notify plugin, after several failed attempts to contact the author requesting that he add the no-spam code to it. I don't like spam. Do you?

This plugin integrates into bbPress and sends a notification via e-mail when new topics or replies are posted. It is fully configurable in the bbPress settings.

Settings include:
* Notification recipients for new topics, 
* Notification recipients for new replies, 
* Notification e-mail's subject and body for both new topics and replies


== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire plugin folder via FTP to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Did you write this plugin? =
No, I simply added a spam filter and a couple of other improvements.

= Why did you do this? =
Because the original author never answered the WP support forums or any emails, for that matter.

= Do you plan on improving the plugin? =
Not really. I just want to stop receiving spam from my bbPress install. However, if you want an improvement badly enough, contact me through vinny [at] usestrict [dot] net.
